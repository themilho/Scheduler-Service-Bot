# Motivation
Everything else sucks

# Features

- Make and Recieve Phone calls

# Providers
- Twillio (SMS, Call)

# Usage

## Example

```js
var Telenode = require('telenode');
var client = new Telenode(Telenode.providers.twilio);

client.credentials({
  sid: 'ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX',
  authToken: 'YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY'
});

client.SMS.send({
  from: '+19171239876', 
  to: '+19171239876', 
  body: 'Hello World'
}, function(err, body) {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('Body: ' + body);
});

```

# Vendors and Authors
Create a file that has the name of the service, place it in the providers directory. Everything that is exported is attached to the new `Telenode` instance. Let's say we create a file called `foobar.js`.

```js
//
// this will become available on the new instance.
//
exports.getSomeInfo = function() { 
  console.log('here it is'); 
};

//
// create containers one level deep. they get bound to the correct context for you.
//
exports.Container = {
  getTheSameInfo: function() { this.getInfo(); },
  getSomeNewInfo: function() { console.log('something new'); }
};

```

```js
var client = new Telenode(new Telenode.providers.foobar);

//
// This is a contrived example that will simply output text to the console,
// but it demonstrates how the module will be attached to the instance.
//
client.Container.getTheSameInfo();
client.Container.getSomeInfo();
```

Often your API service will want to let you know after some operation has finished. The plugin structure provides a web server to listen for API services that want to call back. In your provider module, you can add routes for this.

```js
exports.getSomeInfo = function() { 
  
  this.HTTP.route({

    '/inbound/url/sample/',
    'POST',
    function(data) {

      //
      // handle the inbound request from the API service.
      //
    }
  });
};
```
